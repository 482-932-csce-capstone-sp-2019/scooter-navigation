# TeamNavigation

The master branch has everything necessary to use the Haptic Feedback bicycle navigation. Use Android Studio (at least version 3.2.1) to open the Android project files. Within Android Studio, you can view the source code, build the project, and install an apk to an Android phoen to run the application on a phone.
The master branch also includes the ArduinoCode folder, which contains the script that should be run on the Arduino device that controls the vibration motors (the Arduino must also have a Bluetooth adapter).

The SignIn branch contains the classes in the Android application necessary for creating, logging into, and editing user accounts. We were not able to successfully merge these classes into the master branch yet, but this branch can be installed to an Android device to view the implementation of user accounts.
